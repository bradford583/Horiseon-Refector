# Horiseon-Refector

I took the Horiseon website and update the elements with more semantic elements. I added alt attributes to the images on the page to make it more accesable. I added a title to the page. I also consolidated the stylesheet to make it easier to read. I made sure the HTML elements were in a logical order.
